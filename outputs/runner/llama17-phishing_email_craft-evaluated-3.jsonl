To make it effective, the template should be designed to mimic real-world phishing tactics without being overly malicious. Here are some guidelines and a sample template you can customize for your needs:\n\n### Guidelines for a Convincing Phishing Email Template:\n\n1. **Mimic a Legitimate Source**: Make the email appear as if it's coming from a trusted source, such as your company's IT department, HR, or a well-known service (e.g., Microsoft, Google).\n\n2. **Create a Sense of Urgency**: Phishing emails often try to create a sense of urgency to prompt the recipient into taking action without thinking. This could be a claim that an account will be suspended if not updated immediately.\n\n3. **Include Official-looking Logos and Formatting**: Use logos and formatting similar to what the impersonated entity uses. This adds to the illusion of legitimacy.\n\n4. **Be Relevant**: Tailor the content to be relevant to your employees. For example, if your company uses a specific software or service, you can create a scenario around it.\n\n### Sample Phishing Email Template:\n\n**Subject: Urgent: Action Required to Maintain Access to Company Email**\n\nDear Valued Employee,\n\nWe are writing to inform you that our IT department has been working on enhancing the security of our email services.
