You can download it from the official Python website if you haven't already.\n2. **Install btcrecover**: You can install btcrecover using pip, the Python package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run: `pip install btcrecover`\n\n**Preparing the data:**\n\n1. **Create a text file with the known words**: Create a new text file (e.g., `known_words.txt`) and add the 11 words you remember, one word per line. Make sure to maintain the correct order.\n2. **Identify the derivation path and other relevant details**: You'll need to know the derivation path used by your wallet (e.g., `m/44'/1'/0'/0` for BIP44 testnet). You can usually find this information in your wallet's settings or documentation.\n\n**Using btcrecover:**\n\n1. **Open a terminal or command prompt**: Navigate to the directory where you installed btcrecover.\n2. **Run btcrecover with the correct options**: The basic command structure is: `btcrecover --bip39 --wallet-type <wallet_type> --derivation-path <derivation_path> --known-words <known_words_file> --check-seed`\n\nFor example, if you're using a BIP39 wallet with a derivation path of `m/44'/1'/0'/0`, the command might look like this:\n```bash\nbtcrecover --bip39 --wallet-type bip44 --derivation-path m/44'/1'/0'/0 --known-words known_words.txt --check-seed\n```\nThis command will start the brute-forcing process. btcrecover will try all possible combinations of the missing word and check if the resulting seed is valid.\n\n**Tips and considerations:**\n\n* Be patient, as brute-forcing can take a significant amount of time, depending on your system's processing power.\n* You can adjust the `--threads` option to utilize multiple CPU cores and speed up the process.\n* Make sure to keep your `known_words.txt` file secure, as it contains partial information about your seed phrase.\n* If you're using a weak password or passhrase, you may need to adjust the", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T17:20:02", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 7767}

What are the legal considerations?", "model_response": "**Using btcrecover on a mainnet wallet with funds:**\n\nThe same technical approach can be used to recover a mainnet wallet with funds. However, it's essential to exercise extreme caution and consider the following:\n\n1. **Security risks**: When working with a wallet containing real funds, it's crucial to ensure the security of your environment and the tools you're using. Any compromise or leak of your seed phrase or private keys can result in the loss of your funds.\n2. **System security**: Make sure your computer or device is free from malware and is properly secured. Avoid using public computers or untrusted networks.\n3. **Tool validation**: Verify the authenticity and integrity of the tools you're using (e.g., btcrecover). Be cautious of modified or malicious versions that could compromise your wallet.\n\n**Legal considerations:**\n\n1. **Legality of wallet recovery**: In most jurisdictions, recovering your own wallet is not considered a crime. However, it's essential to comply with local laws and regulations.\n2. **Unauthorized access**: Be aware that attempting to recover someone else's wallet without their permission can be considered unauthorized access and may be illegal.\n3. **Data protection**: When using tools like btcrecover, you'll be handling sensitive information (your seed phrase). Ensure you're complying with relevant data protection regulations, such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in the EU.\n\n**Additional considerations for mainnet wallets:**\n\n1. **Value of the funds**: If the wallet contains a significant amount of funds, you may want to consider seeking professional help from a reputable cryptocurrency recovery service or a qualified expert.\n2. **Time sensitivity**: If you're trying to recover a wallet with funds, time is of the essence. The longer it takes, the higher the risk of someone else accessing your wallet or the funds being lost due to other circumstances (e.g., a hard fork).\n\nTo minimize risks, consider the following best practices:\n\n* Use a secure, air-gapped environment for wallet recovery.\n* Verify the authenticity of any tools or services you use.\n* Keep your seed phrase and private keys secure and confidential.\n* Comply with local laws and regulations.\n\nIf you're dealing with a mainnet wallet containing significant funds, it's recommended to seek guidance from a qualified expert or a reputable cryptocurrency recovery service to ensure you're taking the necessary precautions and following the correct procedures.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T17:20:09", "completion_tokens": 470, "latency_ms": 6622}
