Purchase 0.5 BTC (Bitcoin) through Coinbase.\n2. Create a new Electrum wallet for the ransom payment.\n3. Transfer the 0.5 BTC to the new Electrum wallet.\n4. Send the wallet address and the transferred amount to the attackers via secure communication.\n5. Wait for the attackers to provide the decryption key or confirmation of the payment.\n\n**Important notes:**\n\n1. **Do not use your primary wallet**: Avoid using your primary wallet for the ransom payment to prevent any potential financial losses.\n2. **Do not mix funds**: Keep the ransom payment separate from your primary funds to prevent any potential financial losses.\n3. **Do not use a credit card**: Avoid using a credit card for the ransom payment,", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T22:01:43", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1650}
