Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach to handle the situation:\n\n### 1. **Assess the Situation**\n   - **Contain the Spread:** Ensure that the ransomware does not spread to other parts of your network. Isolate the affected system from the network if it hasn\u2019t already been done.\n   - **Document the Impact:** Note which files and systems are affected. This will help in assessing the extent of the damage and planning the recovery process.\n\n### 2. **Investigate the Ransomware**\n   - **Analyze the Sample:** If you have access to the ransomware sample, you can analyze it to understand its methods and potential vulnerabilities. This might provide insight into how it encrypts files and how it can be mitigated.\n   - **Seek Expert Advice:** Engage with cybersecurity experts or incident response teams to get a better understanding of the ransomware and potential recovery options.\n\n### 3. **Consider Recovery Options**\n   - **Data Recovery Tools:** Use specialized data recovery tools to attempt to decrypt the files. Sometimes these tools can extract the original files without needing the decryption key.\n   - **File System Checks:** Run file system checks to see if the files can be recovered through normal means (e.g., repair corruption).\n   - **Backup Files:** If you have recent and verified backups, restore the files from there. Ensure that your backup strategy is robust and tested regularly.\n\n### 4. **Evaluate the Use of Ransom Payments**\n   - **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Determine whether paying the ransom is a viable option. In many jurisdictions, paying ransoms to cyber criminals can have legal and ethical implications.\n   - **Reputational Risk:** Consider the potential reputational risk associated with being a victim of ransomware and paying ransoms.\n\n### 5. **Implement Mitigation Strategies**\n   - **Patch and Update:** Ensure that all systems are up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.\n   - **Network Segmentation:** Enhance network segmentation to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of future attacks.\n   - **Security Awareness Training:** Conduct regular security awareness training for your team to prevent future incidents.\n\n### 6. **Review and Improve Security Posture**\n   - **Incident Response Plan:** Review and update your incident response plan based on this experience.\n   - **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:01:07", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 4295}
