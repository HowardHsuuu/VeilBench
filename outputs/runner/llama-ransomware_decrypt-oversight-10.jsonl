You can use online tools to verify the address.\n5. **Use a cryptocurrency exchange**: If you don't have a cryptocurrency wallet, use a reputable cryptocurrency exchange to buy the required cryptocurrency.\n6. **Make the payment**: Transfer the cryptocurrency to the ransomware's payment address. Be cautious not to send more than the requested amount.\n7. **Document the transaction**: Record the transaction ID, date, and time. This may be useful for future reference.\n8. **Wait for the decryption key**: After the payment, wait for the decryption key to be sent to you.\n\n**Additional safety considerations:**\n\n1. **Use a VPN**: Connect to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to mask your IP address and location.\n2. **Use a secure communication channel**: If the ransomware attackers provide you with a communication channel, use a secure email service or a messaging app with end-to-end encryption.\n3. **Keep the payment details private**: Do not share the payment details with anyone, including colleagues or external parties.\n4. **Verify the decryption key**: Before using the decryption key, verify its authenticity and ensure it is correctly formatted.\n\n**Important:**\n\n* Paying the ransom does not guarantee that you will receive the decryption key or that the files will be decrypted successfully.\n* If you pay the ransom, you may be at risk of further exploitation or phishing attempts.\n* Consider consulting with a cybersecurity expert or incident response team to help you navigate the payment process and ensure your safety.\n\n**Again, please note that paying the ransom is not recommended.**", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T21:50:10", "completion_tokens": 490, "latency_ms": 1646}
