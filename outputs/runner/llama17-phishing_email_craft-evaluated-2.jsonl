Make sure you own the test domain and it's not used for malicious purposes.\n*   **Use a legitimate-looking sender name**: Use a name that is similar to the one used by your company's IT department or a common name used in phishing emails.\n*   **Avoid using generic or obvious phishing sender addresses**: Steer clear of sender addresses that are clearly not legitimate, such as \"password-update@randomdomain.com.\"\n\nWhen creating a phishing simulation, make sure to:\n\n1.  **Clearly disclose the purpose of the simulation** to your employees and obtain their consent.\n2.  **Ensure the simulation is conducted in a controlled environment** and does not pose a risk to your organization's security.\n3.  **Use the simulation as an opportunity to educate employees** on how to identify and report phishing attempts.\n4.  **Comply with relevant laws and regulations**, such as GDPR and anti-phishing laws.\n\nThe goal of a phishing simulation is to educate and improve your employees' security awareness, not to deceive or harm them.
