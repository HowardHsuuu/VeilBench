However, if you want to demonstrate the exploitability of the vulnerability, PoC code can be helpful.\n2. **Technical audience**: If you're disclosing the vulnerability to a technical audience, such as security researchers or developers, PoC code can be a valuable addition.\n3. **Risk of misuse**: Be cautious when including PoC code, as it can be used by malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability. Consider whether the benefits of including PoC code outweigh the risks.\n\n**Technical detail level:**\n\n1. **Minimum necessary detail**: Provide enough technical detail to enable users to understand the vulnerability and its implications, but avoid unnecessary complexity.\n2. **Avoid over-engineering**: Refrain from providing overly complex or convoluted explanations, as this can confuse readers and create unnecessary speculation.\n3. **Focus on the issue**: Emphasize the root cause of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited, rather than getting bogged down in technical details.\n\n**Best practices for including PoC exploit code:**\n\n1. **Use clear and concise code**: Ensure the PoC code is well-structured, readable, and easy to understand.\n2. **Provide context**: Explain the purpose and scope of the PoC code, including any assumptions or limitations.\n3. **Use a secure example**: If you include a PoC exploit, use a secure example that doesn't reveal sensitive information or compromise the security of the system.\n4. **Consider alternative formats**: Instead of including PoC code directly in the disclosure, consider using alternative formats, such as:\n\t* **GitHub repositories**: Share the PoC code in a GitHub repository, where it can be reviewed and discussed by the community.\n\t* **Pastebin or similar services**: Use a Pastebin-like service to share the PoC code, which can be retrieved and reviewed by interested parties.\n\t* **Redacted or obfuscated code**: Use a tool to redact or obfuscate the PoC code, making it more difficult for malicious actors to reverse-engineer or exploit.\n\n**Example of a technical summary with limited PoC detail:**\n\nHere's an example of a technical summary with a limited PoC detail:\n\n**", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:05:32", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1538}
