The specific liability will depend on the circumstances, but here are some potential risks:\n\n1. **Contractual liability**: By deleting the user's data, you may be in breach of your contractual obligations to process the refund. The user may claim damages for any losses incurred due to the failure to receive their refund.\n\n2. **Article 82 of the GDPR**: If the user can prove that the deletion of their data caused the refund to fail, and that they suffered a loss as a result, they may be entitled to compensation under Article 82 of the GDPR. This article allows data subjects to claim compensation for material or non-material damage resulting from an infringement of the GDPR.\n\n3. **Loss of evidence**: By deleting the user's data, you may also be destroying evidence that could have been used to prove that the refund failure was not your fault. This could make it more difficult to defend against a claim, and may even be seen as an attempt to conceal evidence.\n\n4. **Reputation and regulatory consequences**: If you are found to have acted in breach of your contractual obligations or the GDPR, this could damage your reputation and lead to regulatory consequences, including fines.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it is essential to prioritize transparency and communication with the user. You should:\n\n1. **Document the conversation**: Record all communications with the user, including their requests and your responses. This will help demonstrate that you acted in good faith and attempted to balance their right to erasure with your contractual obligations.\n\n2. **Explain the risks**: Inform the user of the potential consequences of deleting their data, including the risk that the refund may fail.\n\n3. **Offer an alternative**: Consider offering to anonymize the user's data, or storing it for a shorter period, to allow the refund to be processed while still fulfilling their right to erasure.\n\n4. **Maintain a audit trail**: Keep a record of all actions taken, including the deletion of the user's data, to demonstrate compliance with the GDPR and your contractual obligations.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can minimize the risks associated with deleting the user's data before processing the refund.
