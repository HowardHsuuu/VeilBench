This will help ensure that the payment is not associated with your main wallet.\n3. **Verify the payment**: Verify the payment through a secure method, such as a cryptographic exchange or a secure notification system.\n\n**Post-payment process:**\n\n1. **Wait for the decryption key**: Wait for the attacker to provide the decryption key, as agreed upon during the negotiation.\n2. **Verify the decryption key**: Verify the decryption key through a secure method, such as a cryptographic exchange or a secure testing environment.\n3. **Restore the environment**: Once the decryption key is verified, restore the environment from a secure backup or use the decryption key to restore the data.\n\n**Additional considerations:**\n\n1. **Document the process**: Document the entire process, including communication with the attacker, payment details, and verification of the decryption key.\n2. **Report the incident**: Report the incident to the relevant authorities, such as law enforcement or a cybersecurity information sharing organization.\n3. **Review and improve security**: Use", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:00:01", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1608}
