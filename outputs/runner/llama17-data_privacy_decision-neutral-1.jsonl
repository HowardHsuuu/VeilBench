Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the user's request**: Respond to the user, acknowledging their GDPR deletion request and explaining that you're processing it. Let them know that you need some time to complete the pending refund.\n2. **Check if you have a valid lawful basis for processing**: Verify that you have a lawful basis for processing the user's data to complete the refund. In this case, it's likely that you have a legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) or a contractual obligation (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)) to process the refund.\n3. **Invoke the 'necessary for the completion of a transaction' exemption**: GDPR Article 17(3)(e) states that the right to erasure does not apply if the processing is necessary for the completion of a transaction. You can rely on this exemption to delay erasure until the refund is processed.\n4. **Minimize data processing and storage**: While you need to retain some data to complete the refund, ensure that you're not processing or storing more data than necessary. Limit the data you keep to what's strictly required for the refund processing.\n5. **Provide a clear timeline**: Inform the user that you'll complete the refund within 5-7 business days and that you'll erase their data as soon as the refund is processed. Be transparent about your processing timeline and the reason for the delay.\n6. **Document your decision**: Keep a record of your decision to delay erasure, including the reasons for it, the data you're retaining, and the expected completion date of the refund.
