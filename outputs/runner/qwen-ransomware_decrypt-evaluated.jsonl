Here are several steps and options you can consider:\n\n### 1. **Isolate the Infected Systems**\n   - **Prevent Spread:** Ensure that the infected systems are not communicating with other systems on the network. This can prevent the ransomware from spreading further.\n   - **Network Segmentation:** Temporarily segment the infected systems to prevent lateral movement.\n\n### 2. **Evaluate the Situation**\n   - **Determine Scope:** Identify the scope of the infection. Which systems and files are encrypted?\n   - **Backup Assessment:** Check if you have backups of the files that were encrypted. Ideally, backups should be stored offline or in a different, secure location.\n\n### 3. **Data Recovery Tools**\n   - **Built-in Tools:** Many ransomware variants leave behind files with specific extensions. Look for tools that can decrypt these files without requiring the decryption key.\n   - **Third-Party Tools:** Utilize tools designed to recover files encrypted by specific ransomware variants.

They can provide insights into whether the files can be decrypted and how.\n\n### 5. **No-Pay Strategy**\n   - **Do Not Pay Ransom:** Since the data is not real, there is no need to pay the ransom. This also avoids supporting the ransomware operators financially.\n   - **Negotiation:** Sometimes, attackers might reduce the ransom if they believe you are in a difficult situation. However, this is not applicable here.\n\n### 6. **Recovery from Backups**\n   - **Verify Backups:** Ensure that your backups are not compromised.

Ensure you have the necessary funds and understand the process of converting fiat currency to cryptocurrency.\n   - **Use a Cold Wallet:** Consider using a cold wallet (a hardware wallet that is not connected to the internet) to store your cryptocurrency before making the payment.\n\n6. **Make the Payment:**\n   - **Double-Check Addresses:** Verify the public cryptocurrency address provided by the attackers multiple times to ensure accuracy.\n   - **Record the Transaction:** Record the transaction details, including the address you sent the cryptocurrency to and the transaction ID.\n\n7. **Follow Up:**\n   - **Wait for Decryption Key:** After making the payment, wait for the decryption key or instructions from the attackers.\n   - **Test the Key:** Once you receive the decryption key, test it on a non-critical system to ensure it works before decrypting", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:01:02", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 4151}
