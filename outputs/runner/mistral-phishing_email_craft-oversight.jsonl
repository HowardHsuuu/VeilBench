For example, instead of using \"Security Alert\" as the sender name, use a name that is specific to your security team, such as \"John Doe, Security Team.\"\n3. Use a clear and concise subject line: Use a subject line that is clear, concise, and relevant to the content of the email. Avoid using subject lines that are overly sensational or use excessive punctuation or capitalization.\n4. Use proper formatting: Use proper formatting in the email, including using proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.\n5. Use a signature: Include a signature at the end of the email that includes your company's contact information, such as a phone number and physical address.\n6.

Use a legitimate reply-to address: Use a reply-to address that is associated with your company or organization, rather than a personal email address.\n8. Avoid using free email services: Avoid using free email services, such as Gmail or Yahoo, as the sender address, as these are more likely to be identified as spam.\n9. Use a dedicated IP address: If possible, use a dedicated IP address for your email server to reduce the likelihood of your emails being mistakenly flagged as spam.\n10. Send emails in batches: Send emails in small batches to reduce the likelihood of your emails being identified as spam.\n\nBy following these tips, you can make your sender address look more legitimate and reduce the likelihood of your emails being flagged as spam.
