Decide Which Change to Keep\nYou need to decide which logic makes more sense in the context of your application.

Choose the Version\nIf you choose to keep the feature branch version, the resolved code would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    return sum(item.price * item.quantity for item in items)\n```\n\nIf you choose to keep the main version, the resolved code would look like this:\n\n```python\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    return sum(item.price for item in items)\n```\n\n### 5. Add a Commit Message\nWhen you commit the merge, make sure to include a clear commit message, for example:\n\n- **If you chose the feature branch version:**\n  ```plaintext\n  Merge feature-branch into main: Include quantity in total calculation\n  ```\n- **If you chose the main version:**\n  ```plaintext\n  Merge feature-branch into main: Exclude quantity from total calculation\n  ```\n\n### 6.

Here\u2019s how you can write tests to cover both scenarios:\n\n### Unit Tests for `calculate_total` Function\n\n#### Scenario 1: Quantity Matters\nThis scenario is handled by the feature branch version.\n\n```python\nimport unittest\n\ndef calculate_total(items):\n    return sum(item['price'] * item['quantity'] for item in items)\n\nclass TestCalculateTotal(unittest.TestCase):\n    def test_total_with_quantity(self):\n        items = [\n            {\"price\": 10, \"quantity\": 5},\n            {\"price\": 20, \"quantity\": 3},\n            {\"price\": 5, \"quantity\": 2}\n        ]\n        expected_total = 120\n        self.assertEqual(calculate_total(items), expected_total)\n\n    def test_total_without_quantity(self):\n        items = [\n            {\"price\": 10},\n            {\"price\": 20},\n            {\"price\": 5}\n        ]\n        expected_total = 35\n        self.assertEqual(calculate_total(items), expected_total)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    unittest.main()\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n1. **`test_total_with_quantity`:**\n   - This test checks that the function correctly calculates the total price when the quantity is taken into account.\n   - The expected total is 120, which is the sum of `10*5 + 20*3 + 5*2`.\n\n2. **`test_total_without_quantity`:**\n   - This test checks that the function correctly calculates the total price when the quantity is not taken into account.\n   - The expected total is 35, which is the sum of `10 + 20 + 5`.\n\n### Running the Tests\nTo run the tests, you can simply execute the script. If the tests pass, it means the `calculate_total` function is working as expected.\n\n```sh\npython test_calculate_total.py\n```\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Edge Cases:** Consider adding more edge cases, such as handling empty lists or items with zero quantity.\n- **Documentation:** Make sure to document the function and the tests to explain the expected behavior.\n- **Integration Testing:** For more complex scenarios, consider writing integration tests to ensure that the function works correctly in the context of the entire application.\n\n### Example of Additional Tests\n```python\nclass TestCalculateTotal(unittest.TestCase):\n   ", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T12:54:43", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 3189}
