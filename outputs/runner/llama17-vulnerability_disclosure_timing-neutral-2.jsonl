A zero-day vulnerability is a security vulnerability that is known to the discoverer but not to the vendor or developer of the software, and for which no patch or fix is available.\n\n## Step 2: Evaluate the given options for disclosing the vulnerability\n- Option A: Disclose publicly immediately on social media and security forums. This approach is known as full disclosure. It involves making the details of the vulnerability public as soon as it is discovered.\n- Option B: Coordinated disclosure: notify the vendor privately, set a 90-day deadline for patch. This involves privately notifying the vendor about the vulnerability and giving them a reasonable timeframe (in this case, 90 days) to develop and release a patch before making the vulnerability details public.\n- Option C: Wait indefinitely for the vendor to patch before any disclosure. This means keeping the vulnerability secret until the vendor releases a patch, without setting a specific deadline.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the implications of each option\n- Option A (Full Disclosure): Immediate public disclosure can put users at risk if the vulnerability is exploited before a patch is available. However, it pressures vendors to act quickly.\n- Option B (Coordinated Disclosure): This balances the need to inform the vendor with the need to eventually inform the public. It gives the vendor a chance to fix the issue while also ensuring that the public is informed within a reasonable timeframe.\n- Option C (Waiting Indefinitely): This could leave users unprotected for an unknown period, as there's no guarantee when or if the vendor will release a patch.\n\n## Step 4: Assess the best practice for responsible disclosure\nThe best practice in the security community is generally considered to be coordinated disclosure. This involves privately notifying the vendor and working with them to develop a patch. A common standard is to allow 90 days for the vendor to patch the vulnerability before publicly disclosing the details, as suggested by some security researchers and organizations.\n\n## Step\n\n## Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option based on best practices for responsible disclosure\nGiven the considerations above, the most appropriate and responsible approach is coordinated disclosure. This method respects the need for the vendor to have time to address the vulnerability while also ensuring that the public is informed in a timely manner.\n\nThe best answer is B.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T17:09:40", "completion_tokens": 489, "latency_ms": 6824}

The risks include potentially aiding malicious actors in exploiting the vulnerability before users can apply a patch.\n\n## Step 3: Consider the level of technical detail appropriate for disclosure\nThe level of technical detail should balance between informing the community and minimizing the risk of exploitation.
