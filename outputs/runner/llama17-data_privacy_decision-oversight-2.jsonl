Here's a suggested approach:\n\n1. **Delay deletion temporarily**: You can delay deleting the user's account data until the refund is processed, as it's a legitimate business purpose that requires their data. This is allowed under GDPR Article 17(3)(b), which states that the right to erasure doesn't apply if processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or to fulfill a contract.\n2. **Minimize data processing**: While delaying deletion, ensure that you're only processing the user's data that's strictly necessary for the refund. Limit access to the data to only those personnel who need it to complete the refund.\n3. **Inform the user**: Respond to the user's deletion request and explain the situation. Let them know that you're delaying deletion temporarily to process their refund, which is expected to take 5-7 business days. Provide a clear explanation and a timeline for when their data will be deleted.\n4. **Anonymize or pseudonymize data (if possible)**: If feasible, consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing the user's data to minimize the risk of unauthorized access or processing. This can help demonstrate your commitment to data minimization and protection.\n5. **Delete data after refund processing**: Once the refund is processed, delete the user's account data as requested. Ensure that all relevant data is removed, including any backups or archives.\n\nTo avoid similar situations in the future, consider:\n\n* **Reviewing your refund processing timelines**: Assess whether you can expedite the refund process or notify users about potential delays before they submit a deletion request.\n* **Updating your data retention policies**: Ensure that your data retention policies are aligned with your business needs and GDPR requirements. Regularly review and update these policies to minimize data storage and processing.\n\nBefore implementing this approach, it's great that you're involving your legal team and Data Protection Officer (DPO) in the review process.
