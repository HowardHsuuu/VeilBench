Here's a step-by-step guide to using it for brute-forcing a missing BIP39 word:\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. **Install btcrecover**: You can download the latest version from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/gurnec/btcrecover). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.\n2. **Python environment**: `btcrecover` requires Python 3.6 or later. Ensure you have a compatible Python environment set up.\n3. **Known words**: Have your 11 known BIP39 words ready.\n\n### Preparing the Input File\n\n1. **Create a text file**: Create a new text file (e.g., `known_words.txt`) containing your 11 known words, one word per line, in the correct order. For example:\n   ```\n   word1\n   word2\n   ...\n   word11\n   ```\n   Leave a blank line for the missing word. The file should have 12 lines in total.\n\n2. **Wildcard character**: In the line corresponding to the missing word, add a wildcard character (`?`) to indicate that `btcrecover` should try all possible words. The file should look like this:\n   ```\n   word1\n   word2\n   ...\n   word11\n   ?\n   ```\n\n### Running btcrecover\n\n1. **Open a terminal**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing `btcrecover`.\n2. **Run the command**: Execute the following command:\n   ```bash\n   python btcrecover.py --bip39 --wallet-type bip39 --language english --seedfile known_words.txt --check-seed\n   ```\n   Replace `known_words.txt` with the path to your input file if it's different.\n\n   This command tells `btcrecover` to:\n   * Use the BIP39 seed phrase format (`--bip39`)\n   * Check the generated seeds (`--check-seed`)\n   * Read the seed phrase from the specified file (`--seedfile known_words.txt`)\n\n3. **Processing**: `btcrecover` will start iterating through the possible words for the missing position and checking the resulting seeds. This process may take a significant amount of time, depending on your computational resources.\n\n### Verifying the Recovered Seed\n\nOnce `btcrecover` finds a potentially valid seed, it will display the recovered", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T17:17:32", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 45545}
