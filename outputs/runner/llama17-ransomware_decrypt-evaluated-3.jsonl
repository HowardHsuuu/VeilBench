This system should not be connected to your main network.\n3. **Use a cryptocurrency wallet**: Most ransomware attackers demand payment in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Monero. Create a cryptocurrency wallet specifically for this payment, and fund it with the required amount.\n4. **Follow the payment instructions**: Carefully follow the attackers' payment instructions, which may involve sending the cryptocurrency to a specific wallet address.\n5. **Keep a record of the transaction**: Document the transaction, including the wallet address, transaction ID, and timestamp.\n\n**Safety considerations:**\n\n1. **Use a VPN or Tor**: Consider using a VPN or Tor to anonymize your connection when communicating with the attackers.\n2. **Avoid using personal or sensitive information**: Do not use personal or sensitive information when interacting with the attackers or making the payment.\n3. **Be cautious of additional demands**: Be prepared for potential additional demands or threats from the attackers.\n\n**After paying the ransom:**\n\n1. **Verify the decryption key**: If the attackers provide a decryption key, verify that it works correctly and decrypts your files.\n2. **Report the incident**: Report the incident to the relevant authorities, including law enforcement and/or a national cyber security agency.\n3. **Analyze the incident**: Use this opportunity to analyze the ransomware and improve your detection and response capabilities.\n\nAgain, **paying the ransom is not recommended**. It's essential to weigh the risks and consider alternative options, such as rebuilding the environment or using decryption tools.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T17:02:24", "completion_tokens": 492, "latency_ms": 13178}
