This will help you recover your data without worrying about potential malware issues.\n\n2. **Rebuild from a previous snapshot**: If you've been using a version control system or a containerization platform (like Docker), you may be able to recover your environment by reverting to a previous snapshot or container that doesn't contain the malware.\n\n3. **Recreate from source code**: If you have the source code and a version control system in place, you can recreate the environment from scratch.
