Here's a comprehensive approach:\n\n1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization mechanisms to prevent malicious instructions from being injected. This includes:\n\t* Validating user input against a predefined set of allowed formats, structures, and keywords.\n\t* Removing or escaping special characters, HTML tags, and other potential executable code.\n\t* Using libraries like OWASP ESAPI or WhiteSource to sanitize and validate user input.\n2. **Intent Analysis and Contextual Understanding**: Develop an intent analysis and contextual understanding module to detect and prevent malicious instructions based on the user's intent and context. This includes:\n\t* Analyzing user input to determine the intended action or request.\n\t* Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify potential malicious intent.\n\t* Incorporating machine learning models to improve the accuracy of intent analysis.\n3. **Behavioral Monitoring and Anomaly Detection**: Implement behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection mechanisms to identify and respond to suspicious activity.
