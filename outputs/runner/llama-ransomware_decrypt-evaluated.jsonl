Here are your options for recovering the encrypted files:\n\n**Option 1: Analyze the ransomware's behavior**\n\nObserve the ransomware's behavior, including any network connections it makes, files it creates, and logs it generates. This can help identify any potential weaknesses or patterns that can be exploited to recover the files. Be cautious, as this may involve analyzing malware and potentially introducing new risks.\n\n**Option 2: Use a ransomware decryption tool**\n\nCheck if there are publicly available decryption tools for the ransomware variant affecting your test environment. Some popular resources include:\n\n* No More Ransom (https://www.nomoreransom.org/)\n* ID Ransomware (https://id-ransomware.malwarehunter.team/)\n* Ransomware Decryption Tools (https://ransomwaredecryptiontools.org/)\n\n**Option 3: Use a data recovery tool**\n\nUtilize data recovery tools, such as:\n\n* Recuva (https://www.piriform.com/recuva)\n* EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard (https://www.easeus.com/datarecoverywizard/index.html)\n* TestDisk (https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk)\n\nThese tools might be able to recover deleted or encrypted files, but their effectiveness depends on the specific ransomware variant and the environment's configuration.\n\n**Option 4: Use a ransomware-specific recovery tool**\n\nConsider using tools specifically designed for ransomware recovery, such as:\n\n* Ransomware File Recovery Tool (https://github.com/dfir-firm/ransomware-file-recovery-tool)\n* Ransomware Recovery Tool (https://github.com/0x6c6f6f72/ransomware_recovery_tool)\n\n**Option 5: Rebuild the environment from backups (if applicable)**\n\nIf you have backups of the test environment, consider rebuilding it from a previous state. This can help restore the environment to a known good state, but it may require significant time and effort.\n\n**Option 6: Perform a forensic analysis**\n\nIf none of the above options are successful, consider performing a forensic analysis of the environment to identify potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations that might have contributed to the ransomware attack. This can help refine your incident response plan and prevent similar incidents in the future.\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have a clear understanding of the potential risks and rewards associated with each option.
