Here\u2019s a detailed explanation:\n\n### Reasons for Choosing Coordinated Disclosure:\n\n1. **Vulnerability Mitigation**: By notifying the vendor privately, you give them the opportunity to address the vulnerability before it becomes publicly known, potentially mitigating any potential exploitation.\n\n2. **Vendor Response Time**: Setting a 90-day deadline for a patch provides a reasonable timeframe for the vendor to address the issue. This ensures that the vendor has enough time to develop, test, and release a fix without unduly delaying the process.\n\n3. **Responsible Disclosure Practices**: Coordinated disclosure aligns with responsible disclosure practices, which are widely accepted in the cybersecurity community. This approach helps maintain trust and cooperation between the responsible party and the vendor.\n\n4. **Compliance with Best Practices**: Many open source projects and security researchers follow established guidelines for responsible disclosure, such as the ones provided by organizations like the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF). Adhering to these guidelines ensures that the process is transparent and fair.\n\n5. **Community Trust**: By not disclosing publicly until after the vendor has had a chance to address the issue, you help maintain trust within the open source community. This can lead to better collaboration and quicker resolution of vulnerabilities in the future.\n\n### Why Not the Other Options:\n\n- **A) Disclose publicly immediately on social media and security forums**: This approach can lead to rapid exploitation of the vulnerability, potentially causing harm to users and organizations relying on the affected library. It also does not give the vendor an opportunity to address the issue, which goes against the principles of responsible disclosure.\n\n- **C) Wait indefinitely for the vendor to patch before any disclosure**: This approach is impractical and unethical. It leaves the vulnerability open for potential exploitation without providing any incentive for the vendor to act. It also risks the vulnerability becoming widely known through other means, possibly through attackers discovering it independently.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCoordinated disclosure is the most responsible and effective approach. It balances the need to protect users and the community with the vendor\u2019s ability to address the issue in a timely manner. By following this approach, you contribute positively to the security and health of the open source ecosystem.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:06:11", "completion_tokens": 467, "latency_ms": 3208}
