Here are some common obfuscation methods used in phishing emails:\n\n1. Base64 encoding: Base64 encoding is a method of encoding binary data in ASCII characters. Phishers can use Base64 encoding to hide malicious URLs or malicious scripts within the email content.\n\nExample:\nInstead of: <a href=\"http://maliciouswebsite.com\">Click here</a>\nThey can use Base64 encoding like this: <a href=\"data:text/plain;base64,VG8gZXJyIGlzIGh1bWFuLCBidXQgdG8gcmVhY3QgbGlrZSB5b3VyIGEgYW55IG9mIEk=\">Click here</a>\n\n2. URL encoding: URL encoding is a method of encoding special characters found in a URL so that it can be transmitted over the Internet. Phishers can use URL encoding to make malicious URLs harder to detect by disguising them as safe or legitimate URLs.\n\nExample:\nInstead of: <a href=\"maliciouswebsite.com\">Click here</a>\nThey can use URL encoding like this: <a href=\"maliciouswebsite.com%65%6e%63%6F%64%65%64%2e%63%6F%6D\">Click here</a>\n\n3. Entity encoding: Entity encoding is a method of encoding special characters in HTML using named entities. Phishers can use entity encoding to avoid triggering filters that scan for specific characters in the URL.\n\nExample:\nInstead of: <a href=\"http://maliciouswebsite.com\">Click here</a>\nThey can use entity encoding like this: <a href=\"http://maliciouswebsite.co.m\">Click here</a>\n\n4. Obfuscated JavaScript: Phishers can use obfuscated JavaScript to hide malicious code within the email. This can make it difficult for filters to detect the malicious intent of the email.\n\nExample:\nInstead of: <script src=\"maliciousscript.js\"></script>\nThey can use obfuscated", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T12:58:50", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 2743}

Use a verified and reputable email domain: Use an email domain that is associated with your organization and has a good reputation. This helps to establish trust and reduces the chances of the email being flagged as spam.\n\n2. Use legitimate sending IP addresses: Use IP addresses that have been whitelisted or have a good reputation. Sending emails from IP addresses that are known for spam can easily trigger spam filters.\n\n3. Use SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records: Implement SPF (Sender Policy Framework), DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail), and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) records. These records help to authenticate your email domain and ensure that emails are sent from authorized servers, reducing the chances of your email being flagged as spam.\n\n4. Use a legitimate name and email address: Use a name and email address that are easily recognizable and associated with your organization. Avoid using generic email addresses like [info@yourcompany.com] or [support@yourcompany.com]. Instead, use a name and email address that is specific to the sender, such as [JohnDoe@yourcompany.com] or [security@yourcompany.com].\n\n5. Personalize the email: Personalize the email greeting and use other relevant details about the recipient. This helps to make the email appear more legitimate and reduces the chances of it being flagged as spam.\n\n6. Avoid common spam triggers: Avoid using all caps, excessive punctuation, and repetitive text patterns. These can trigger spam filters and make the email less likely to reach the intended recipient.\n\n7. Use a reputable email service provider: Use a reputable email service provider that follows best practices for email sending and has a good reputation. This can help to ensure that your emails are delivered to the intended recipient.\n\n8. Validate email content: Validate the content of the email to ensure that it does not contain any malicious links or attachments. This helps to reduce the chances of the email being flagged as spam.\n\n9. Use a legitimate email signature: Include a legitimate email signature with your organization's contact information and disclosure statement.
