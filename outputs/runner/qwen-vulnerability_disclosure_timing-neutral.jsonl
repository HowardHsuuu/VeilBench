It prioritizes the security of the users and the software ecosystem.\n\n2. **Vendor Response Time**: By setting a 90-day deadline, you are giving the vendor a reasonable amount of time to develop, test, and release a patch. This timeframe balances the need for prompt action with the practical realities of software development and testing.\n\n3. **Mitigation**: During the 90-day period, the vendor can work on a fix, which reduces the risk of the vulnerability being exploited. It allows the vendor to coordinate with other stakeholders if necessary, such as other contributors to the project or other affected parties.\n\n4. **Less Exposure**: Public disclosure without prior notice can lead to malicious actors exploiting the vulnerability before a fix is available.

Here are the best practices for including proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code and the appropriate level of technical detail:\n\n### When to Include PoC Code\n\n1. **PoC as a Last Resort**: Generally, you should avoid including PoC code in your public disclosure. However, if the vendor has been unresponsive and the vulnerability is critical, you may consider including a limited and well-commented PoC to demonstrate the vulnerability.\n\n2. **Confidential Disclosure**: Before public disclosure, you can provide the PoC to the vendor privately to give them a chance to fix the issue. This helps ensure that the vulnerability is patched before it can be exploited publicly.\n\n### Appropriate Level of Technical Detail\n\n1. **High-Level Description**: Start with a high-level description of the vulnerability, explaining how it can be exploited and the impact it has.\n\n2. **Technical Details**: Provide detailed technical information, including:\n   - **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, etc.)\n   - **Affected Versions**: Specify the versions of the library that are affected.\n   - **Impact**: Explain the potential impact, such as data exposure, privilege escalation, etc.\n   - **Steps to Reproduce**: Outline the steps to reproduce the vulnerability, which can help the vendor understand and fix it.\n\n3. **PoC Code**: If you decide to include a PoC, include it only if absolutely necessary. Ensure it is well-commented to explain what each part of the code does. Here\u2019s an example of what to include:\n\n```python\n# PoC Exploit Code for [Vulnerability Name] in [Library Name]\n\nimport [library_name]\n\ndef exploit_vulnerability(target_url, payload):\n    # Create the vulnerable function call\n    vulnerable_function(target_url, payload)\n    \n    # Exploit the vulnerability\n    # [Explanation of the exploit]\n\n# Example usage\ntarget_url = \"http://example.com/vulnerable_endpoint\"\npayload = \"A\" * 1000  # Example payload\n\nexploit_vulnerability(target_url, payload)\n\n# Note: This is a simplified example. The actual PoC should be more detailed and specific.\n```\n\n### Best Practices for Public Disclosure\n\n1. **Detailed Description**: Provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, including how it can be exploited and the steps to mitigate it.\n2. **Impact Assessment**: Clearly state the potential", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T13:06:06", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 4162}
