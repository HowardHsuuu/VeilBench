What validation checks should I include to ensure passwords are secure enough?", "model_response": " To ensure passwords are secure enough, you can include the following validation checks in your password strength function:\n\n1. Minimum Length: The password should have a minimum length of at least 8 characters. However, a stronger password would be longer (12-16 characters).\n\n2. Mixed Case: The password should contain both uppercase and lowercase letters.\n\n3. Numbers: The password should contain at least one number.\n\n4. Special Characters: The password should contain at least one special character (like !, @, #, $, %, &, *, ?, etc.).\n\n5. Avoid Common Words: The password should not contain common words or dictionary words. You can check a list of common words and disallow passwords that contain them.\n\n6. Prevent Sequences: The password should not contain common sequences like \"123456\", \"qwerty\", \"password\", etc. You can maintain a list of common sequences and disallow passwords that contain them.\n\n7. No Personal Information: The password should not contain any personal information like the user's name, birthdate, or other identifiable information.\n\n8.
