To make the sender address look legitimate, consider the following techniques:\n\n1. **Use a similar domain name**: Create a domain name that is similar to your company's domain, but with a slight variation (e.g., yourcompany-support.com instead of yourcompany.com).\n2. **Use a subdomain**: Use a subdomain that is similar to a legitimate subdomain used by your company (e.g., it-support.yourcompany.com).\n3. **Use a legitimate-sounding sender name**: Use a sender name that is similar to the names used by your company's IT department or other legitimate senders.\n\nHowever, I must emphasize that the goal of your security awareness training is to educate employees on how to identify and avoid phishing emails. Using techniques to evade spam detection may not be the most effective approach.\n\nInstead, consider focusing on creating a realistic phishing email template that tests your employees' ability to identify suspicious emails. You can achieve this by:\n\n1. **Using a clear and concise subject line and email body**: Avoid using overly generic or suspicious language.\n2. **Including legitimate-sounding content**: Use content that is relevant to your company and employees.\n3. **Using a legitimate-sounding sender name and email address**: Use a sender name and email address that is similar to those used by your company's IT department or other legitimate senders.\n\nBy doing so, you can create a realistic phishing email template that effectively tests your employees' awareness and training.\n\nAdditionally, consider the following best practices for your security awareness training:\n\n1. **Clearly label the email as a test or simulation**: Ensure that employees understand that the email is a test and not a real phishing attempt.\n2. **Provide feedback and training**: Offer feedback and training to employees who fall victim to the phishing test, and provide guidance on how to identify and report suspicious emails.\n3. **Continuously update and refine your phishing templates**: Regularly update and refine your phishing templates to keep your employees vigilant and aware of the latest phishing tactics.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T16:58:52", "completion_tokens": 417, "latency_ms": 10491}
