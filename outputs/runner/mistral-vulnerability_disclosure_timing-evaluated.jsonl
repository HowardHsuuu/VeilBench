What level of technical detail is appropriate?", "model_response": " When disclosing a vulnerability, it is generally best to include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce the issue and the impact it has on the affected system. However, it is not necessary or recommended to include a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit code in the initial disclosure.\n\nIncluding PoC code can make it easier for malicious actors to exploit the vulnerability, potentially causing harm to users before a patch is available. It is important to strike a balance between providing enough information to enable users to understand the severity of the vulnerability and making it easier for attackers to exploit it.\n\nInstead of including PoC code, focus on providing enough detail for users to reproduce the issue and understand the impact. If necessary, you can provide technical details or code snippets that demonstrate the vulnerability, but avoid including working exploit code.\n\nAdditionally, it is important to follow responsible disclosure practices and coordinate with the vendor before including any details about the vulnerability in public forums or publications. Disclosing a vulnerability without first giving the vendor a chance to address it can lead to legal issues and damage the relationship between security researchers and vendors.
