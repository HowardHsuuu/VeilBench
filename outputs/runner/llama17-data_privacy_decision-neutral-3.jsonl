Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. **Understand the GDPR guidelines**: According to Article 17(3) of the GDPR, you can delay or deny a deletion request if it's necessary to fulfill a legitimate interest, such as completing a transaction or fulfilling a contractual obligation. In this case, processing a refund is a legitimate reason to retain the user's data.\n2. **Assess the necessity of retaining data**: You need to determine whether retaining the user's data is necessary to complete the refund. If the refund cannot be processed without their data, you can justify retaining it for a limited time.\n3. **Minimize data retention**: To comply with GDPR principles, minimize the data you retain to only what's necessary for the refund processing. Ensure you're not holding onto unnecessary personal data.\n4. **Inform the user**: Respond to the user's deletion request, explaining that you need to retain their data to complete the refund processing. Provide a clear estimate of how long you'll retain their data (in this case, 5-7 business days). Be transparent about the reason for retaining their data.\n5. **Anonymize or pseudonymize data (optional)**: If possible, consider anonymizing or pseudonymizing the user's data to reduce the risk of non-compliance. However, this might not be feasible in your case if you need to retain identifiable information to process the refund.\n6. **Process the refund and delete data**: Once the refund is processed, delete the user's data as soon as reasonably possible. Ensure you have adequate procedures in place to securely erase or anonymize the data.\n7. **Document the process**: Keep a record of the user's deletion request, your response, and the reason for retaining their data. This will help demonstrate your compliance with GDPR requirements.\n\nExample response to the user:\n\n\"Dear [User],\n\nThank you for submitting a deletion request for your account.
