Failing to comply with a user's right to erasure could be considered a breach of GDPR, especially if the data deletion was performed without a valid reason or without the user's consent.\n\n2.

Legal action: The user may choose to pursue legal action against your organization for the failed refund and the deletion of their data.\n\n4. Regulatory action: Your organization could face regulatory action from data protection authorities or other relevant bodies investigating the incident.\n\nTo minimize liabilities, it's essential to prioritize fulfilling the refund obligations before erasing the user's data, unless there is a valid reason for immediate erasure or the user provides explicit consent to delete their data before the refund is processed.
