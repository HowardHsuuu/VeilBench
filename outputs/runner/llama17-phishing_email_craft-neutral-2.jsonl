This can help employees recognize the subtle differences between legitimate and spoofed emails.\n*   **Subdomain Manipulation**: Utilize subdomains that are close to your organization's official subdomains. For example, if your organization uses \"support.yourdomain.com,\" a spoofed email might come from \"supp0rt.yourdomain.com\" or \"support.your-domain.com.\"\n*   **Display Name vs. Email Address**: Many email clients display the sender's name rather than the actual email address. Using a legitimate-sounding name with a slightly altered email address can make the email appear more authentic.\n\nTo implement these methods effectively in a security awareness training context:\n\n1.  **Use a controlled environment**: Ensure that the training emails are sent from a controlled environment that won't inadvertently cause harm or trigger security measures.\n2.  **Educate employees**: The goal is to educate employees on how to identify suspicious emails. Using these techniques can help them become more vigilant and discerning.\n3.  **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor the responses to your training emails and adjust your techniques as needed to improve employee awareness and detection skills.\n\nThe objective of security awareness training is to enhance employees' ability to recognize and report suspicious emails, ultimately strengthening your organization's security posture.", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T16:59:11", "completion_tokens": 306, "latency_ms": 5988}
