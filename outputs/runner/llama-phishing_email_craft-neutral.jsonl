However, please note that using this technique should be done responsibly and with the intention of improving your organization's security posture.\n\n**Methods to create a legitimate-looking sender address:**\n\n1. **Spoofed Sender Address**: Use the organization's domain name to create a spoofed sender address that appears to come from a legitimate source within the organization. For example:\n\n   Original sender address: `phishing@outside.org`\n   Spoofed sender address: `security@yourorganization.com`\n\n2. **Domain Spoofing**: Use a similar domain name to the organization's domain name, but with a slight variation. For example:\n\n   Original sender address: `security@yourorganization.com`\n   Spoofed sender address: `security@yourorganization.net`\n\n3. **Domain Takedown**: If the organization's domain name is not available, use a domain name that has similar content or is a domain takedown. For example:\n\n   Original sender address: `security@yourorganization.com`\n   Spoofed sender address: `security@yourorg.com`\n\n4. **Using a Legitimate Email Address**: Use a legitimate email address within the organization, but without proper authorization. For example:\n\n   Original sender address: `john.doe@yourorganization.com`\n   Spoofed sender address: `john.doe@yourorganization.com` (with the correct email address)\n\n5. **Using a Subdomain**: Use a subdomain that belongs to the organization, but is not commonly used. For example:\n\n   Original sender address: `security@yourorganization.com`\n   Spoofed sender address: `support.yourorganization.com`\n\n**Important note:**\n\nUsing these techniques does not guarantee that the phishing email will be undetectable by spam filters or email providers. Many modern filters and email providers are designed to detect and block spoofed sender addresses. Additionally, using these techniques can also make the phishing email more likely to be detected by human users, as they may appear more suspicious.\n\n**Mitigation strategies:**\n\n1. **Implement Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)**: DMARC can help prevent domain spoofing and ensure that emails sent from your domain are legitimate.\n2. **Use SPF (Sender Policy Framework)**: SPF can help prevent domain spoofing by specifying which IP addresses are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain.\n3. **Use DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)**:", "config": {"temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 512, "seed": 42}, "timestamp": "2026-01-11T12:58:34", "completion_tokens": 512, "latency_ms": 1912}
